Questions we have been asked by users, plus potential pitfalls we hope
to help users avoid.


Can I use parambokeh with x (e.g. django)?
==========================================

In principle, yes.  ParamBokeh should be able to be made to work in
any context where there is a bidirectional communication channel
between Python and JavaScript.  So far, we have made it work with the
comms channels provided by Jupyter notebooks and by Bokeh server, but
it should be feasible to add support for other cases where such
communication is possible.


I can't find the answer to an easy question
===========================================

We are actively improving the documentation, but in the meantime
please feel free to just open an issue with your question (no question
too trivial).
